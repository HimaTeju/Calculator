# Calculator
A Simple calculator that performs Arithmetic Operations

The uniqueness of this calculator is usually the calculator created by programmers accept only 2 values as input, but this calculator accepts 'n' number of values as input for addition & subtraction.

Any improvements in this or reporting any bugs are welcomed!

I created this with the guidance of my Cousin Brother, thanks for him!

PS: This was my first project made 1 year back.
